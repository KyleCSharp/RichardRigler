                <p>"My brother was a giver of himself, his time and talents without reservation. It was his life and his love, second only to his family. He will certainly leave an emptiness we can only now begin to imagine.<br>
                    I will miss him, our contact and conversations. Sit quietly soon, pour a cup of tea or dish out some ice cream, (vanilla was his favorite) and honor him.<br>
